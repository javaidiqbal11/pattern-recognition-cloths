# Cloths Pattern Recognition 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cloth pattern recognition using deep learning approaches. The goal is to build a model that can classify different clothing patterns, such as stripes, polka dots, plaid, floral, and more. By leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we aim to achieve high accuracy in detecting and categorizing various cloth patterns. This application can be integrated into fashion recommendation systems, inventory management, or even fabric production processes.
